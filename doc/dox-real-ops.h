 * approximation is between [0, 1[.
 *
 * Examples:
\verbatim
 value | exponent | log2
=======|==========|=======
   1.0 |        0 | 0
   2.0 |        1 | 1
   3.0 |        1 | 1.585

   4.1 |        2 | 2.036

 *
 * \warning This function assumes a positive value (non-zero). If the value is negative the sign bit will
 * modify the returned value. An input value of zero will return the bias of the floating-point
 * representation. If you compile with Vc runtime checks, the function will assert
 * values greater than or equal to zero.
 *
 * You may use abs to apply this function to negative values:
 * \code
 * abs(v).exponent()
 * \endcode
