The %Vc library is a collection of SIMD vector classes with existing implementations for SSE, AVX,
and a scalar fallback. An implementation for the Intel Xeon Phi is expected to be ready for %Vc
0.8.

Per default, code compiled against the %Vc headers will use the instruction set that the compiler
says is available. For example compiling with "g++ -mssse3" will enable compilation against the
SSE implementation using SSE the instruction sets SSE, SSE2, SSE3 and SSSE3. If you want to force
compilation against a specific implementation of the vector classes you can set the macro
Vc_IMPL to either "Scalar", "SSE", "SSE2", "SSE3", "SSSE3", "SSE4_1", "SSE4_2", or "AVX".
You may additionally append "+XOP", "+FMA4", "+SSE4a", "+F16C", and "+POPCNT", e.g. "-D Vc_IMPL=SSE+XOP+FMA4"
Setting Vc_IMPL to
"SSE" will force the SSE instruction set, but lets the headers figure out the version to use or,
if that fails, uses SSE4.1.
After you include a %Vc header, you will have the following macros available, which you can (but
normally should not) use to determine the implementation %Vc uses:
\li \c Vc_IMPL_Scalar
\li \c Vc_IMPL_SSE (shorthand for SSE2 || SSE3 || SSSE3 || SSE4_1. SSE1 alone is not supported.)
\li \c Vc_IMPL_SSE2
\li \c Vc_IMPL_SSE3
\li \c Vc_IMPL_SSSE3
\li \c Vc_IMPL_SSE4_1
\li \c Vc_IMPL_SSE4_2
\li \c Vc_IMPL_AVX

Another set of macros you may use for target specific implementations are the \c Vc_*_V_SIZE
macros: \ref Utilities



\page intro Introduction

If you are new to vectorization please read this following part and make sure you understand it:
\li Forget what you learned about vectors in math classes. SIMD vectors are a different concept!
\li Forget about containers that also go by the name of a vector. SIMD vectors are a different concept!
\li A vector is defined by the hardware as a special register which is wider than required for a
single value. Thus multiple values fit into one register. The width of this register and the
size of the scalar data type in use determine the number of entries in the vector.
Therefore this number is an unchangeable property of the hardware and not a variable in the
%Vc API.
\li Note that hardware is free to use different vector register widths for different data types.
For example AVX has instructions for 256-bit floating point registers, but only 128-bit integer
instructions.

\par Example 1:

You can modify a function to use vector types and thus implement a horizontal vectorization. The
original scalar function could look like this:
\code
void normalize(float &x, float &y, float &z)
{
  const float d = std::sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
  x /= d;
  y /= d;
  z /= d;
}
\endcode
To vectorize the \c normalize function with %Vc, the types must be substituted by their %Vc counterparts and math functions
must use the %Vc implementation (which is, per default, also imported into \c std namespace):
\code
using Vc::float_v;

void normalize(float_v &x, float_v &y, float_v &z)
{
  const float_v d = Vc::sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
  x /= d;
  y /= d;
  z /= d;
}
\endcode
The latter function is able to normalize four 3D vectors when compiled for SSE in the same
time the former function normalizes one 3D vector.

For completeness, note that you can optimize the division in the normalize function further:
\code
  const float_v d_inv = float_v::One() / Vc::sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
  const float_v d_inv = Vc::rsqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z); // less accurate, but faster
\endcode
Then you can multiply \c x, \c y, and \c z with \c d_inv, which is considerably faster than three
divisions.

As you can probably see, the new challenge with %Vc is the use of good data-structures which
support horizontal vectorization. Depending on your problem at hand this may become the main
focus of design (it does not have to be, though).

\section intro_alignment Alignment

\subsection intro_alignment_background What is Alignment

If you do not know what alignment is, and why it is important, read on, otherwise skip to \ref
intro_alignment_tools. Normally the alignment of data is an implementation detail left to the
compiler. Until C++11, the language did not even have any (official) means to query or modify
alignment.

Most data types require more than one Byte for storage. Thus, even most atomic data types span
several locations in memory. E.g. if you have a pointer to \c float, the address stored in this
pointer just determines the first of four Bytes of the \c float. Naively, one could think that
any address (which belongs to the process) can be used to store such a float. While this is true
for some architectures, some architectures may terminate the process when a misaligned pointer is
dereferenced. The natural alignment for atomic data types typically is the same as their size.
Thus the address of a \c float object should always be a multiple of 4 Bytes.

Alignment becomes more important for SIMD data types.
1. There are different instructions to load/store aligned and unaligned vectors. The unaligned
load/stores recently were greatly improved in x86 CPUs. Still, the rule of thumb
says that aligned loads/stores are faster.
2. Access to an unaligned vector with an instruction that expects an aligned vector crashes the
application. Once you write vectorized code you might want to make it a habit to check crashes
for unaligned addresses.
3. Memory allocation on the heap will return addresses aligned to some system specific alignment
rule. E.g. Linux 32bit aligns on 8 Bytes, while Linux 64bit aligns on 16 Bytes. Both alignments
are not strict enough for AVX vectors. Worse, if you develop on Linux 64bit with SSE you won't
notice any problems until you switch to a 32bit build or AVX.
4. Placement on the stack is determined at compile time and requires the compiler to know the
alignment restrictions of the type.
5. The size of a cache line is just two or four times larger than the SIMD types (if not equal).
Thus, if you load several vectors consecutively from memory every fourth, second, or even every
load will have to be read from two different cache lines. This is called a cache line split. They
lead to degraded performance, which becomes very noticeable for memory intensive code.

\subsection intro_alignment_tools Tools

%Vc provides several classes and functions to get alignment right.
\li Vc::VectorAlignment is a compile time constant that equals the largest alignment restriction
                  (in Bytes) for the selected target architecture.
\li Vc::AlignedBase, Vc::VectorAlignedBase, and Vc::MemoryAlignedBase implement the alignment
                  restrictions needed for aligned vector loads and stores. They set the
                  alignment attribute and reimplement the \c new and \c delete operators,
                  returning correctly aligned pointers to the heap.
\li Vc::malloc and Vc::free are meant as replacements for \c malloc and \c free. They can be used
                  to allocate any type of memory with an abstract alignment restriction: \ref
                  Vc::MallocAlignment. Note, that (like \c malloc) the memory is only allocated
                  and not initialized. If you allocate memory for a type that has a constructor,
                  use the placement new syntax to initialize the memory.
\li Vc::Allocator is an STL compatible allocator class that behaves as specified in the C++
                  specification, implementing the optional support for over-aligned types.
                  Therefore, memory addresses returned from this allocator will always be
                  aligned to at least the constraints attached to the type \c T. STL containers
                  will already default to Vc::Allocator for Vc::Vector<T>. For all other
                  composite types you want to use, you can take the \ref Vc_DECLARE_ALLOCATOR
                  convenience macro to set is as default.
\li Vc::Memory, Vc::Memory<V, Size, 0u>, Vc::Memory<V, 0u, 0u>
                  The three different variants of the memory class can be used like a more
                  convenient C-array. It supports two-dimensional statically sized arrays and
                  one-dimensional statically and dynamically sized arrays. The memory can be
                  accessed easily via aligned vectors, but also via unaligned vectors or
                  gathers/scatters.



\page portability Portability Issues

One of the major goals of %Vc is to ease development of portable code, while achieving highest
possible performance that requires target architecture specific instructions. This is possible
through having just a single type use different implementations of the same API depending on the
target architecture. Many of the details of the target architecture are often dependent on the
compiler flags that were used. Also there can be subtle differences between the implementations
that could lead to problems. This page aims to document all issues you might need to know about.

\par Compiler Flags

\li \e GCC: The compiler should be called with the -march=\<target\> flag. Take a look at the GCC
manpage to find all possibilities for \<target\>. Additionally it is best to also add the -msse2
-msse3 ... -mavx flags. If no SIMD instructions are enabled via compiler flags, %Vc must fall back
to the scalar implementation.
\li \e Clang: The same as for GCC applies.
\li \e ICC: Same as GCC, but the flags are called -xAVX -xSSE4.2 -xSSE4.1 -xSSSE3 -xSSE3 -xSSE2.
\li \e MSVC: On 32bit you can add the /arch:SSE2 flag. That's about all the MSVC documentation
says. Still the MSVC compiler knows about the newer instructions in SSE3 and upwards. How you can
determine what CPUs will be supported by the resulting binary is unclear.

\par Where does the final executable run?

You must be aware of the fact that a binary that is built for a given SIMD hardware may not run
on a processor that does not have these instructions. The executable will work fine as long as no
such instruction is actually executed and only crash at the place where such an instruction is
used. Thus it is better to check at application start whether the compiled in SIMD hardware is
really supported on the executing CPU. This can be determined with the
currentImplementationSupported function.

If you want to distribute a binary that runs correctly on many different systems you either must
restrict it to the least common denominator (which often is SSE2), or you must compile the code
several times, with the different target architecture compiler options. A simple way to combine
the resulting executables would be via a wrapping script/executable that determines the correct
executable to use. A more sophisticated option is the use of the ifunc attribute GCC provides.
Other compilers might provide similar functionality.

\par Guarantees

It is guaranteed that:
\li \code int_v::Size == uint_v::Size == float_v::Size \endcode
\li \code short_v::Size == ushort_v::Size \endcode

\par Important Differences between Implementations

\li Obviously the number of entries in a vector depends on the target architecture.
\li Hardware that does not support 16-Bit integer vectors can implement the short_v and ushort_v
API via 32-Bit integer vectors. Thus, some of the overflow behavior might be slightly different,
and truncation will only happen when the vector is stored to memory.

\section portability_compilerquirks Compiler Quirks

Since SIMD is not part of the C/C++ language standards %Vc abstracts more or less standardized
compiler extensions. Sadly, not every issue can be transparently abstracted.
Therefore this will be the place where differences are documented:
\li MSVC is incapable of parameter passing by value, if the type has alignment restrictions. The
consequence is that all %Vc vector types and any type derived from Vc::VectorAlignedBase cannot be
used as function parameters, unless a pointer is used (this includes reference and
const-reference). So \code
void foo(Vc::float_v) {}\endcode does not compile, while \code
void foo(Vc::float_v &) {}
void foo(const Vc::float_v &) {}
void foo(Vc::float_v *) {}
\endcode all work.
Normally you should prefer passing by value since a sane compiler will then pass the data in a
register and does not have to store/load the data to/from the stack. %Vc defines \c
Vc_PASSING_VECTOR_BY_VALUE_IS_BROKEN for such cases. Also the %Vc vector types contain a composite
typedef \c AsArg which resolves to either const-ref or const-by-value. Thus, you can always use
\code void foo(Vc::float_v::AsArg) {}\endcode.



\page featuremacros Feature Macros

The following macros are available to enable/disable selected features:

\par Vc_NO_STD_FUNCTIONS

If this macro is defined, the %Vc math functions are
not imported into the \c std namespace. They are still available in the %Vc namespace.

\par Vc_CLEAN_NAMESPACE

If this macro is defined, any symbol or macro that does not have a %Vc
prefix will be disabled.

\par Vc_NO_VERSION_CHECK

Define this macro to disable the safety check for the libVc version.
The check generates a small check for every object file, which is called at startup, i.e. before
the main function.

\par Vc_CHECK_ALIGNMENT

If this macro is defined %Vc will assert correct alignment for all
       objects that require correct alignment. This can be very useful to debug crashes resulting
       from misaligned memory accesses. This check will introduce a significant overhead.

\par Vc_ENABLE_FLOAT_BIT_OPERATORS

Define this macro to enable bitwise operators (&, |, ^) on floating-point vectors. Since these
operators are not provided for the builtin floating-point types, the default is to not provide
them for SIMD vector types as well.



\page buildsystem Build System

%Vc uses CMake as its buildsystem. It also provides much of the CMake logic it
uses for itself for other projects that use CMake and %Vc. Here's an (incomplete) list of features
you can get from the CMake scripts provided with %Vc:
\li check for a required %Vc version
\li locate libVc and %Vc includes
\li compiler flags to workaround %Vc related quirks/bugs in specific compilers
\li compiler flags to enable/disable SIMD instruction sets, defaulting to full support for the
host system

\section buildsystem_variables CMake Variables

To make use of these features simply copy the FindVc.cmake as installed by %Vc to your project.
Add \code find_package(Vc [version] [REQUIRED]) \endcode to your CMakeLists.txt. After that you
can use the following variables:
\li \e Vc_FOUND: tells whether the package was found
\li \e Vc_INCLUDE_DIR: you must add this to your include directories for the targets that you
want to compile against %Vc: \code include_directories(${Vc_INCLUDE_DIR}) \endcode
\li \e Vc_DEFINITIONS: recommended preprocessor definitions. You can use them via \c add_definitions.
\li \e Vc_COMPILE_FLAGS: recommended compiler flags. You can use them via the
\li \e Vc_ARCHITECTURE_FLAGS: recommended compiler flags for a selected target
microarchitecture. You can use them via the \c COMPILE_OPTIONS property or via \c
add_compile_options.
\li \e Vc_ALL_FLAGS: a list combining the above three variables. Use it to conveniently
set all required compiler flags in one place (e.g. via \c add_compile_options).

The following variables might be of interest, too:
\li \e Vc_SSE_INTRINSICS_BROKEN
\li \e Vc_AVX_INTRINSICS_BROKEN
\li \e Vc_XOP_INTRINSICS_BROKEN
\li \e Vc_FMA4_INTRINSICS_BROKEN

\section buildsystem_macros CMake Macros

The macro vc_compile_for_all_implementations is provided to help with compiling a given source
file multiple times with all different possible SIMD targets for the given architecture.
Example:
\verbatim
vc_compile_for_all_implementations(objs src/trigonometric.cpp
  FLAGS -DSOME_FLAG
  EXCLUDE Scalar SSE2)
\endverbatim
You can specify an arbitrary number of additional compiler flags after the FLAGS argument. These
flags will be used for all compiler calls. After an optional EXCLUDE argument you can specify targets
that you want to exclude. After an optional ONLY argument you can specify targets that you want
to compile for. (So either you exclude some, or you explicitly list the targets you want.)

Often it suffices to have SSE2 or SSE3 as the least common denominator and provide SSE4_1 and
AVX. Here is the currently complete list of possible targets the macro will compile for:
\li Scalar
\li SSE2
\li SSE3
\li SSSE3
\li SSE4_1
\li SSE4_2
\li SSE3+SSE4a
\li SSE+XOP+FMA4
\li AVX
\li AVX+XOP+FMA4

\section buildsystem_other Using Vc without CMake

If your project does not use CMake all you need to do is the following:
\li Find the header file "Vc/Vc" and add its path to your include paths.
\li Find the library libVc and link to it.
\li Ensure you use the right compiler flags to enable the relevant SIMD instructions.


\defgroup Vectors Vectors
\defgroup Masks Masks
\defgroup SimdArray SIMD Array

\defgroup Utilities Utilities


\addtogroup Vectors

The vector classes abstract the SIMD registers and their according instructions into types that
feel very familiar to C++ developers.

Note that the documented types Vc::float_v, Vc::double_v, Vc::int_v, Vc::uint_v, Vc::short_v,
and Vc::ushort_v are actually \c typedefs of the \c Vc::Vector<T> class:
\code
namespace Vc {
  template<typename T> class Vector;
  typedef Vector<double> double_v;
  typedef Vector<float> float_v;
  // ...
}
\endcode

\par Some general information on using the vector classes:

Generally you can always mix scalar values with vectors as %Vc will automatically broadcast the
scalar to a vector and then execute a vector operation. But, in order to ensure that implicit
type conversions only happen as defined by the C standard, there is only a very strict implicit
scalar to vector constructor:
\code
int_v a = 1;     // good:             int_v(int)
uint_v b = 1u;   // good:             uint_v(unsigned int)
uint_v c = 1;    // does not compile: uint_v(int)
float_v d = 1;   // does not compile: float_v(int)
float_v e = 1.;  // does not compile: float_v(double)
float_v f = 1.f; // good:             float_v(float)
\endcode

The following ways of initializing a vector are not allowed:
\code
int_v v(3, 2, 8, 0); // constructor does not exist because it is not portable
int_v v;
v[0] = 3; v[1] = 2; v[2] = 8; v[3] = 0; // do not hardcode the number of entries!
// You can not know whether somebody will compile with %Vc Scalar where int_v::Size == 1
\endcode

Instead, if really necessary you can do:
\code
Vc::int_v v;
for (int i = 0; i < int_v::Size; ++i) {
  v[i] = f(i);
}
// which is equivalent to:
v.fill(f);
// or:
v = int_v::IndexesFromZero().apply(f);
\endcode



\addtogroup Masks

Mask classes are abstractions for the results of vector comparisons. The actual implementation
differs depending on the SIMD instruction set. On SSE they contain a full 128-bit datatype while
on a different architecture they might be bit-fields.


\addtogroup Utilities

Additional classes, macros, and functions that help to work more easily with the main vector
types.


\addtogroup Math

Functions that implement math functions. Take care that some of the implementations will return
results with less precision than what the FPU calculates.


\addtogroup SimdArray

This set of (template) classes provides types that allow an arbitrarily sized set of
values of an arithmetic type, much like a \c std::array. But in contrast to \c
std::array the types behave like the SIMD vector types, implementing all needed
operators and functions.
