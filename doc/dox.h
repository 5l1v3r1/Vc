 *
 * Per default, code compiled against the Vc headers will use the instruction set that the compiler
 * says is available. For example compiling with "g++ -mssse3" will enable compilation against the
 * SSE implementation using SSE the instruction sets SSE, SSE2, SSE3 and SSSE3. If you want to force
 * compilation against a specific implementation of the vector classes you can set the macro
 * VC_IMPL to either "Scalar", "SSE2", "SSE3", "SSSE3", "SSE4_1", "SSE4_2", "SSE4a", or "AVX".
 * Setting VC_IMPL to
 * "SSE" will force the SSE instruction set, but lets the headers figure out the version to use or,
 * if that fails, uses SSE4.1.
 * After you include a Vc header, you will have the following macros available, which you can (but
 * normally should not) use to determine the implementation Vc uses:
 * \li VC_IMPL_Scalar
 * \li VC_IMPL_SSE (shorthand for SSE2 || SSE3 || SSSE3 || SSE4_1. SSE1 alone is not supported.)
 * \li VC_IMPL_SSE2
 * \li VC_IMPL_SSE3
 * \li VC_IMPL_SSSE3
 * \li VC_IMPL_SSE4_1
 * \li VC_IMPL_SSE4_2
 * \li VC_IMPL_SSE4a

/**
 * \page intro Introduction
 *
 * If you are new to vectorization please read this following part and make sure you understand it:
 * \li Forget what you learned about vectors in math classes. SIMD vectors are a different concept!
 * \li Forget about containers that also go by the name of a vector. SIMD vectors are a different concept!
 * \li A vector is defined by the hardware as a special register which is wider than required for a
 * single value. Thus multiple values fit into one register. The width of this register and the
 * size of the scalar data type used normally determine the number of entries in the vector, and
 * thus this number is an unchangeable property of the hardware and therefore not a variable in the
 * Vc API.
 * \li Note that hardware is free to use different vector register widths for different data types.
 * For example AVX has instructions for 256-bit floating point registers, but only 128-bit integer
 * instructions.
 *
 * \par Example 1:
 *
 * You can modify a function to use vector types and thus implement a horizontal vectorization. The
 * original scalar function could look like this:
 * \code
 * void normalize(float &x, float &y, float &z)
 * {
 *   const float d = std::sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
 *   x /= d;
 *   y /= d;
 *   z /= d;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * To vectorize it with Vc the types must be substituted by their Vc counterparts and math functions
 * must simply use the Vc implementation which is not part of the \c std namespace:
 * \code
 * using Vc::float_v;
 *
 * void normalize(float_v &x, float_v &y, float_v &z)
 * {
 *   const float_v d = Vc::sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
 *   x /= d;
 *   y /= d;
 *   z /= d;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The latter function is able to normalize four 3D vectors when compiled for SSE in the same
 * time the former function normalizes one 3D vector.
 *
 * For completeness, note that you can optimize the division in the normalize function further:
 * \code
 *   const float_v d_inv = float_v::One() / Vc::sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
 *   const float_v d_inv = Vc::rsqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z); // less accurate, but faster
 * \endcode
 * Then you can multiply \c x, \c y, and \c z with \c d_inv, which is considerably faster than three
 * divisions.
 *
 * As you can probably see, the new challenge with Vc is the use of good data-structures which
 * support horizontal vectorization. Depending on your problem at hand this may become the main
 * focus of design (it does not have to be, though).

/**
 * \page portability Portability Issues
 *
 * One of the major goals of Vc is to ease development of portable code, while achieving highest
 * possible performance that requires target architecture specific instructions. This is possible
 * through having just a single type use different implementations of the same API depending on the
 * target architecture. Many of the details of the target architecture are often dependent on the
 * compiler flags that were used. Also there can be subtle differences between the implementations
 * that could lead to problems. This page aims to document all issues you might need to know about.
 *
 * \par Compiler Flags
 *
 * \li \e GCC: The compiler should be called with the -march=\<target\> flag. Take a look at the GCC
 * manpage to find all possibilities for \<target\>. Additionally it is best to also add the -msse2
 * -msse3 ... -mavx flags. If no SIMD instructions are enabled via compiler flags, Vc must fall back
 * to the scalar implementation.
 * \li \e Clang: The same as for GCC applies.
 * \li \e ICC: Same as GCC, but the flags are called -xAVX -xSSE4.2 -xSSE4.1 -xSSSE3 -xSSE3 -xSSE2.
 * \li \e MSVC: On 32bit you can add the /arch:SSE2 flag. That's about all the MSVC documentation
 * says. Still the MSVC compiler knows about the newer instructions in SSE3 and upwards. How you can
 * determine what CPUs will be supported by the resulting binary is unclear.
 *
 * \par Where does the final executable run?
 *
 * You must be aware of the fact that a binary that is built for a given SIMD hardware may not run
 * on a processor that does not have these instructions. The executable will work fine as long as no
 * such instruction is actually executed and only crash at the place where such an instruction is
 * used. Thus it is better to check at application start whether the compiled in SIMD hardware is
 * really supported on the executing CPU. This can be determined with the
 * currentImplementationSupported function.
 *
 * If you want to distribute a binary that runs correctly on many different systems you either must
 * restrict it to the least common denominator (which often is SSE2), or you must compile the code
 * several times, with the different target architecture compiler options. A simple way to combine
 * the resulting executables would be via a wrapping script/executable that determines the correct
 * executable to use. A more sophisticated option is the use of the ifunc attribute GCC provides.
 * Other compilers might provide similar functionality.
 *
 * \par Guarantees
 *
 * It is guaranteed that:
 * \li \code int_v::Size == uint_v::Size == float_v::Size \endcode
 * \li \code short_v::Size == ushort_v::Size == sfloat_v::Size \endcode
 *
 * \par Important Differences between Implementations
 *
 * \li Obviously the number of entries in a vector depends on the target architecture.
 * \li Because of the guarantees above, sfloat_v does not necessarily map to a single SIMD register
 * and thus there could be a higher register pressure when this type is used.
 * \li Hardware that does not support 16-Bit integer vectors can implement the short_v and ushort_v
 * API via 32-Bit integer vectors. Thus, some of the overflow behavior might be slightly different,
 * and truncation will only happen when the vector is stored to memory.
 */

/**
 * \defgroup Vectors Vectors
 *
 * The vector classes abstract the SIMD registers and their according instructions into types that
 * feel very familiar to C++ developers.
 *
 * Note that the documented types Vc::float_v, Vc::double_v, Vc::int_v, Vc::uint_v, Vc::short_v,
 * and Vc::ushort_v are actually \c typedefs of the \c Vc::Vector<T> class:
 * \code
 * namespace Vc {
 *   template<typename T> class Vector;
 * }
 * \endcode
 */

/**
 * \defgroup Masks Masks
 *
 * Mask classes are abstractions for the results of vector comparisons. The actual implementation
 * differs depending on the SIMD instruction set. On SSE they contain a full 128-bit datatype while
 * on a different architecture they might be bit-fields.
